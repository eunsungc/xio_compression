* Turn on debug print in Globus toolkit
   - GT: Make -e BUILD_DEBUG=
   - xio_compression: dbug->printf
* Search pthead option
   - set GLOBUS_THREAD_MODEL in globus_thread.h; globus_thread_set_model(GLOBUS_THREAD_MODEL_PTHREADS);
   - in _activate() ==> FAIL
   - should set environment variable GLOBUS_THREAD_MODEL to pthread prior to starting server&client
* Create a pool of threads in _open_cb()
   - implement globus_l_xio_compression_mt_write()

[Sep. 6.]
* Implement *_thread_kicker() & *_compression_mt_write()
   - 

[Sep. 9.]
* include BLOSC library
   - compile BLOSC
      1) mkdir build;cd build 2) cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local $HOME/blosc-1.2.3
   - modify Makefile:add -lblosc everywhere -lglobus_common appears

 * replace compress/decompress function
   - look into examples of BLOSC

 [Sep. 10.]
  * Makefile modification
   - add -lblosc everywhere -lglobus_common appears

[Sep. 11.]
* ERROR: globus_xio: An end of file occurred.
  - 
* Remove mutex protection in compress&decompress
  
[Oct. 25]
  * Fix "An end of file occurred" BUG: due to compression driver is not loaded at other sites. exp_name should be set to arg[1] at all nodes.
  * ERROR: 2 servers at one node->stalled ==> comment blosc_init(), which should not be called more than once.
  * ERROR: stalled sometimes when thread_join() implementation... due to message buffer allocation..
    - msg size -> 51MB * 10
  * blosc multithreading issues....=>mutex lock on the decompress() codes & set_nrthread()
  * measure cluster-wide spend time to accurately measure throughput-->DONE
  * d2d implementation
